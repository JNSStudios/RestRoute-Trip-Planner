# ðŸš— RestRoute Trip Planner

**RestRoute** is a React-based trip planning web app that helps you automatically find rest stops and lodging along your driving route using the Google Maps API.

Input your start and end destinations, how long you want to drive per day, and how often you'd like to rest â€” RestRoute calculates your travel segments and locates hotels or rest stops at each break point.
